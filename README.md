This project builds a neural network to predict whether an organization will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. It preprocesses data, trains a deep learning model, and evaluates its accuracy.

## Acknowledgment
I got help with optimization from **Stack Exchange** and the **AI Learning Assistant**.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-challenge.git
